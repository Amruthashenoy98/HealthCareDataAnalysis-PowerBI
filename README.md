## Project Overview
This project involves developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze and report on Emergency Room (ER) visit data for healthcare patients. The primary objective is to provide healthcare professionals with actionable insights into patient visit trends, resource utilization, and overall ER performance. Key metrics and visualizations included in the dashboard focus on:

- Patient Visit Trends: Understanding the volume and patterns of ER visits over time.
- Wait Time Analysis: Monitoring the time patients spend from check-in to being seen by a healthcare provider.
- Resource Allocation: Evaluating the utilization of medical staff and facilities during peak hours.
- Patient Demographics: Analyzing the demographic information of patients to identify at-risk groups

### Tools used:
Microsoft Power BI(Data cleaning, Data Modelling, DAX functions)

### Insights from the Emergency Room Visit Analysis Dashboard:

##### Patient Visit Distribution:
- The total number of patient visits recorded is 4,632, with a nearly equal split between those with administrative privileges (49.35%) and those without (50.65%).
- Most visits occurred on weekdays (3.3K), compared to weekends (1.3K), indicating a higher influx of patients during regular working days.
##### Patient Demographics:
- The majority of patients are adults (3,550), with significantly fewer visits from other age groups, including middle childhood (389), teenagers (369), early childhood (222), and infants (102).
- The gender breakdown shows a slight majority of female patients (51.47%) compared to male patients (48.23%), with a very small percentage (0.30%) identifying as other or declining to specify.
Service and Satisfaction Scores:

- The average satisfaction score stands at 5.45, indicating a moderate level of patient satisfaction.
A significant portion of services (75.71%) were not rated, which could indicate a gap in feedback collection or a need for improvement in patient follow-up.
- The average wait time is approximately 35.53 minutes, which might be a point of concern depending on the context and expectations for emergency room services.
##### Department Referrals:
- The General Practice department received the highest number of referrals (924), followed by Orthopedics (469) and Physiotherapy (164).
- Specialized departments such as Cardiology, Neurology, and Renal had significantly fewer referrals, suggesting that most cases were either general or orthopedic in nature.
##### Trends Over Time:
- The number of total visits peaked in March (540), possibly due to seasonal factors or specific health-related events, with the lowest in December (164).
- The year-over-year trend shows an increase in patient visits from 2019 to 2020, which could be indicative of growing demand or other external factors.
Wait Time Analysis:

- The heatmap analysis reveals that certain racial groups, such as African Americans and Asians, experienced higher wait times in the age groups 31-40 and 61-70. This may point to potential disparities in service delivery that need further investigation.
Patient Admission Types:

- A larger percentage of patients were walk-ins (58.85%), compared to referred patients (41.15%), suggesting that the emergency room is a primary point of contact for a significant portion of the patient population.
