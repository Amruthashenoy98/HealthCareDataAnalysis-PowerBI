### Insights from the Emergency Room Visit Analysis Dashboard:

##### Patient Visit Distribution:
- The total number of patient visits recorded is 4,632, with a nearly equal split between those with administrative privileges (49.35%) and those without (50.65%).
- Most visits occurred on weekdays (3.3K), compared to weekends (1.3K), indicating a higher influx of patients during regular working days.
##### Patient Demographics:
- The majority of patients are adults (3,550), with significantly fewer visits from other age groups, including middle childhood (389), teenagers (369), early childhood (222), and infants (102).
- The gender breakdown shows a slight majority of female patients (51.47%) compared to male patients (48.23%), with a very small percentage (0.30%) identifying as other or declining to specify.
Service and Satisfaction Scores:

- The average satisfaction score stands at 5.45, indicating a moderate level of patient satisfaction.
A significant portion of services (75.71%) were not rated, which could indicate a gap in feedback collection or a need for improvement in patient follow-up.
- The average wait time is approximately 35.53 minutes, which might be a point of concern depending on the context and expectations for emergency room services.
##### Department Referrals:
- The General Practice department received the highest number of referrals (924), followed by Orthopedics (469) and Physiotherapy (164).
- Specialized departments such as Cardiology, Neurology, and Renal had significantly fewer referrals, suggesting that most cases were either general or orthopedic in nature.
#####Trends Over Time:
- The number of total visits peaked in March (540), possibly due to seasonal factors or specific health-related events, with the lowest in December (164).
- The year-over-year trend shows an increase in patient visits from 2019 to 2020, which could be indicative of growing demand or other external factors.
Wait Time Analysis:

- The heatmap analysis reveals that certain racial groups, such as African Americans and Asians, experienced higher wait times in the age groups 31-40 and 61-70. This may point to potential disparities in service delivery that need further investigation.
Patient Admission Types:

- A larger percentage of patients were walk-ins (58.85%), compared to referred patients (41.15%), suggesting that the emergency room is a primary point of contact for a significant portion of the patient population.
